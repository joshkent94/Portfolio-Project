## General info
This is the first project I've created. It's intended to be a JavaScript app that randomly generates a CrossFit related message. The message is made up of three sections; who the message relates to, the subject the message relates to, and the final 'favourite' declaration. It forms part of the Codecademy full-stack development course.
